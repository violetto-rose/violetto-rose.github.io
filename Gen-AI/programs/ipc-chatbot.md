# Build a chatbot for the Indian Penal Code. We'll start by downloading the official Indian Penal Code document, and then we'll create a chatbot that can interact with it. Users will be able to ask questions about the Indian Penal Code and have a conversation with it.

### Python Code:

```python
import re

# Function to load the IPC document
def load_ipc_text(file_path):
	with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
		return file.read()
		
# Function to search for the relevant section based on the question
def search_ipc_section(question, ipc_text):
	# Extract the section number from the question (e.g., "Section 302")
	match = re.search(r"section (\d+)", question, re.IGNORECASE)
		
	if match:
		section_number = match.group(1) # Get the section number from the question
			
		# Search for the section in the IPC text
		section_pattern = rf"(?<=Section {section_number}\.)(.*?)(?=Section \d+\.|$)"
		section_match = re.search(section_pattern, ipc_text, re.DOTALL)
			
		if section_match:
			return section_match.group(0).strip()
		else:
			return f"Sorry, Section {section_number} not found in the IPC."
	else:
		return "Please ask about a specific section number (e.g., 'What is Section 302?')"

# Main function to run the IPC chatbot
def ipc_chatbot():
	# Load the IPC document
	ipc_text = load_ipc_text('ipc.txt') # Ensure 'ipc.txt' file is in the correct path
	print("Indian Penal Code Chatbot :")
	print("You can ask about any section of the IPC. Type 'exit' to quit.")
		
	while True:
		# Take user input
		question = input("You: ")
		if question.lower() == 'exit':
			break
			
		# Get the answer from the IPC text
		answer = search_ipc_section(question, ipc_text)
			
		# Display the response
		print("Bot:", answer)
